This prevents the users from seeing the latest changes, and sometimes leads to confusion. Thus, a cache-bypassing mechanism is needed.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nCachebuster intercepts all HTTP requests, and adds a timestamp to the URL in the form of a query parameters. For example, an HTTP request to URL `http://yasa.gs/` will actually be made to the URL `http://yasa.gs/?cachebusterTimestamp=1383291810660`.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
